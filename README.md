## I have included the following for my target audience

# Site Design

## Composition
* [Inknut Antiqua](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inknut+Antiqua?query=inknut). - Font is being used for all headings.
* [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon). - Font is used for all other text 
* I feel as though these two fonts fit
  well together and compliment my site as a whole, I have used sans serif as a fall back font
  this is a general font and easy to read.
* I have used appropriate images for the project idea.
