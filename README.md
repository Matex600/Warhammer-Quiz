# Site Design

## Composition
* [Inknut Antiqua](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inknut+Antiqua?query=inknut). - Font is being used for all headings.
* [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon). - Font is used for all other text 
* I feel that these two fonts fit
  well together and compliment my site. I have used sans serif as backup font,
  this is a general font and easy to read.
* I have used appropriate images for the project idea and purpose.
* The font size I have used is 1.7em for headings, 1.5em for question and other body text and 1.2em for buttons.
  I feel that these font sizes work well and emphasise the importance of the elements.
## Colour Scheme
* color: rgba(29, 29, 27, 0.9); Site background with transparency 0.9 to create my desired effect.
* color: #FFD700; is used for the sites "game-area" I feel it fits with my chosen theme and helps with readability.
* for when the user hovers over a button as well as an underline to help the user with cursor location.
* color: #000000; I chose this colour for text inside the gold game areas to improve readability.#
* I have primarily used Hex for my colour scheme but to reach the effect for my background I used rgba also.
